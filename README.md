[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/TheBlackBeans/beans.svg?branch=rust-dev)](https://travis-ci.com/TheBlackBeans/beans)

Beans is a language-oriented programing language.
It may change it's syntax, and the attached semantic, during compilation, in order to always write idiomatic code, no matter what problem you are trying to solve

*Warning*: Beans is still in pre-release.
The python implementation is only a proof-of-concept, which is now considered discontinued.

This project is maintained by TheBlackBeans.
