# Presentation

This book will introduce you to parsing and transliteration, using Beans. Beans is written in 
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), and henceforth this book will assume familiarity with this 
language.

Beans aims at being a general-purpose parser and lexer library, providing both enough performance so
that you should never *need* something faster (even though these options exist), and enough 
expressiveness so that you never get stuck while using your parser. See the [tradeoffs](details/tradeoff.md) section for more details.

Beans is free and open source, dual licensed MIT or GPL3+, at your choice.
